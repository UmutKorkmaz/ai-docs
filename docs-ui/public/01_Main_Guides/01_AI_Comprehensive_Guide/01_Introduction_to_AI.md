## What is Intelligence?

Intelligence encompasses the ability to:
- Learn from experience
- Understand complex ideas
- Adapt to new situations
- Solve problems
- Make decisions
- Create and innovate

Intelligence is not a single attribute but a combination of cognitive abilities that allow organisms to function effectively in their environment. While human intelligence is often the benchmark, intelligence manifests differently across species and can be artificially created.

## Defining Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence is the field of computer science dedicated to creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes:

### Narrow AI (Weak AI)
Systems designed to perform specific tasks:
- Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Image recognition systems
- Recommendation algorithms
- Autonomous vehicle navigation

**Characteristics**:
- Task-specific capabilities
- Limited to trained domains
- No consciousness or self-awareness
- Most current AI systems fall in this category

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
Systems with human-level intelligence across all domains:
- Can learn any intellectual task that humans can
- Capable of abstract reasoning and creativity
- Can adapt to novel situations
- Currently theoretical, not yet achieved

**Challenges**:
- Common sense reasoning
- Transfer learning across domains
- Emotional intelligence
- Self-awareness and consciousness

### Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)
Systems that exceed human intelligence in all areas:
- Would surpass human cognitive abilities
- Could solve problems beyond human comprehension
- May develop goals misaligned with human values
- Subject of much philosophical and ethical debate

## The AI Effect

The AI Effect describes the phenomenon where as soon as AI achieves something, it's no longer considered "real intelligence." This moving goalpost has been a constant throughout AI's history.

**Examples of the AI Effect**:
- **Chess**: Once considered the pinnacle of intelligence, now solved by computers
- **Mathematical proofs**: Automated theorem proving is now standard
- **Language translation**: Once thought to require true understanding, now routine
- **Image recognition**: Previously considered uniquely human, now automated

**Implications**:
- AI progress is often underestimated
- Definitions of intelligence constantly evolve
- Human exceptionalism persists despite technological advances
- The goalposts for "true AI" continuously shift

## Why AI Matters Today

**Current AI Capabilities**:
- Processing vast amounts of data
- Recognizing patterns beyond human perception
- Operating 24/7 without fatigue
- Making consistent, data-driven decisions
- Learning from experience at scale

**Real-World Impact**:
- Healthcare: Disease diagnosis and drug discovery
- Finance: Fraud detection and algorithmic trading
- Transportation: Autonomous vehicles and traffic optimization
- Education: Personalized learning and tutoring
- Environment: Climate modeling and resource management
