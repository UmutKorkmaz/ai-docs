# 5. Graph Neural Networks

## Overview

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are specialized architectures designed to process graph-structured data, learning representations by propagating information along graph edges. This chapter provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation for understanding GNNs, their architectural variants, and applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Master the mathematical foundations of graph neural networks
- Understand message passing and aggregation mechanisms
- Analyze GNN architectures and their theoretical properties
- Implement GNNs for various graph-based tasks

## 5.1 Graph Representation Learning

### 5.1.1 Graph Notation and Basics

**Graph Definition:**
A graph $G = (V, E)$ consists of:
- Node set $V$ with $|V| = n$ nodes
- Edge set $E \subseteq V \times V$
- Node features $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$
- Optional edge features $E \in \mathbb{R}^{|E| \times f}$

**Graph Types:**
- **Undirected**: $(i,j) \in E \iff (j,i) \in E$
- **Directed**: Edges have specific direction
- **Heterogeneous**: Multiple node/edge types
- **Dynamic**: Graph structure changes over time

**Adjacency Matrix:**
$A_{ij} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } (i,j) \in E \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$

**Degree Matrix:**
$D_{ii} = \sum_j A_{ij}$, $D_{ij} = 0$ for $i \neq j$

**Laplacian Matrix:**
$L = D - A$ (unnormalized)
$\mathcal{L} = I - D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}$ (normalized)

### 5.1.2 Graph Learning Tasks

**Node-Level Tasks:**
- **Node Classification**: Predict node labels
- **Node Regression**: Predict continuous node values
- **Node Embedding**: Learn node representations

**Edge-Level Tasks:**
- **Link Prediction**: Predict missing edges
- **Edge Classification**: Predict edge labels
- **Edge Regression**: Predict edge weights

**Graph-Level Tasks:**
- **Graph Classification**: Classify entire graphs
- **Graph Regression**: Predict graph properties
- **Graph Generation**: Generate novel graphs

### 5.1.3 Message Passing Framework

**General Formulation:**
GNNs follow the message passing paradigm:

$m_i^{(l)} = \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} M^{(l)}(h_i^{(l)}, h_j^{(l)}, e_{ij})$
$h_i^{(l+1)} = U^{(l)}(h_i^{(l)}, m_i^{(l)})$

Where:
- $\mathcal{N}(i)$ is the neighborhood of node $i$
- $M^{(l)}$ is the message function at layer $l$
- $U^{(l)}$ is the update function at layer $l$

**Key Components:**
1. **Message Function**: How to compute messages
2. **Aggregation Function**: How to combine messages
3. **Update Function**: How to update node states

## 5.2 GNN Architectures

### 5.2.1 Spectral Methods

**Graph Fourier Transform:**
Eigen-decomposition of graph Laplacian: $L = U \Lambda U^T$

**Graph Convolution:**
In Fourier domain: $\hat{h}^{(l+1)} = \sigma(\hat{\Theta}^{(l)} \cdot \Lambda \hat{h}^{(l)})$

**Spectral Convolution:**
$h^{(l+1)} = \sigma(U \hat{\Theta}^{(l)} U^T h^{(l)})$

**ChebNet:**
Chebyshev polynomial approximation:
$h^{(l+1)} = \sigma(\sum_{k=0}^{K} \theta_k^{(l)} T_k(\tilde{L}) h^{(l)})$

Where $T_k$ are Chebyshev polynomials and $\tilde{L} = 2\lambda_{max}^{-1}L - I$

### 5.2.2 Spatial Methods

**GCN (Graph Convolutional Network):**
$h_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i) \cup \{i\}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{|\mathcal{N}(i)||\mathcal{N}(j)|}} W^{(l)} h_j^{(l)})$

Matrix form: $H^{(l+1)} = \sigma(\tilde{D}^{-1/2} \tilde{A} \tilde{D}^{-1/2} H^{(l)} W^{(l)})$

Where $\tilde{A} = A + I$ is the adjacency matrix with self-loops

**GraphSAGE:**
Inductive learning with neighbor sampling:

$\tilde{h}_{\mathcal{N}(i)}^{(l)} = \text{AGGREGATE}^{(l)}(\{h_j^{(l)}, \forall j \in \mathcal{N}(i)\})$
$h_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma(W^{(l)} \cdot \text{CONCAT}(h_i^{(l)}, \tilde{h}_{\mathcal{N}(i)}^{(l)}))$

**Aggregation Functions:**
- Mean: $\tilde{h}_i = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{N}(i)|} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} h_j$
- Pooling: $\tilde{h}_i = \gamma(\{h_j, j \in \mathcal{N}(i)\})$
- LSTM: $\tilde{h}_i = \text{LSTM}(\{h_j, j \in \mathcal{N}(i)\})$

### 5.2.3 Attention-Based GNNs

**GAT (Graph Attention Network):**

Multi-head attention: $h_i' = ||_{k=1}^{K} \sigma(\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \alpha_{ij}^k W^k h_j)$

**Advantages:**
- Dynamic neighborhood weighting
- No predefined graph structure needed
- Interpretable attention weights

### 5.2.4 Higher-Order GNNs

**GIN (Graph Isomorphism Network):**
$h_i^{(l+1)} = \text{MLP}^{(l)}((1 + \epsilon^{(l)}) \cdot h_i^{(l)} + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} h_j^{(l)})$

**Powerful Properties:**

**Max Pooling:**
$\tilde{h}_i = \text{MAX}_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \{h_j\}$

**Attention-Based Aggregation:**
$\tilde{h}_i = \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \alpha_{ij} h_j$

**Learnable Aggregation:**
$\tilde{h}_i = \text{MLP}(\{h_j, j \in \mathcal{N}(i)\})$

- **Adaptive Sampling**: Learn sampling policies

**Memory Efficiency:**
Neighbor sampling reduces memory requirements:

### 5.3.3 Edge Features and Directionality

**Edge-Enhanced GNNs:**
Incorporate edge features in message passing:
$m_{ij} = M(h_i, h_j, e_{ij})$

**Directed GNNs:**
Handle directed graphs:
- Separate in/out neighborhoods

## 5.4 Temporal and Dynamic GNNs

### 5.4.1 Temporal Graph Networks

**Time-Evolving Graphs:**
Graphs that change over time: $G_t = (V_t, E_t)$

**Temporal Message Passing:**
$m_i^{(l)}(t) = \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_t(i)} M^{(l)}(h_i^{(l)}(t), h_j^{(l)}(t), e_{ij}(t))$
$h_i^{(l+1)}(t) = U^{(l)}(h_i^{(l)}(t), m_i^{(l)}(t))$

**Temporal Aggregation:**
Combine information across time:
$h_i(t) = \text{AGG}_{\tau \leq t} \{h_i(\tau)\}$

### 5.4.2 Dynamic Graph Learning

**Graph Structure Learning:**
Learn graph structure alongside node representations:
$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{task} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{structure}$

**Continuous-Time GNNs:**
Model continuous-time dynamics:
$\frac{dh_i(t)}{dt} = f(h_i(t), \{h_j(t), j \in \mathcal{N}(i)\})$

**Online Learning:**

$h_i^{(t+1)} = \text{UPDATE}(h_i^{(t)}, \text{new\_information})$
