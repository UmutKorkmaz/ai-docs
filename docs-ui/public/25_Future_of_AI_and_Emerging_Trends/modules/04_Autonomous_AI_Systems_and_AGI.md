# Autonomous AI Systems and AGI

## Overview
Autonomous AI Systems and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represent the frontier of AI development, focusing on systems that can operate independently, set their own goals, and potentially achieve human-level or superhuman intelligence across domains. This module explores advanced autonomous systems, AGI pathways, and the implications of self-improving AI.
