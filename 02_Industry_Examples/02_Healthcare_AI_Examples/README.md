## Navigation

Each module includes:
- **Standardized headers** with module overview and table of contents
- **Cross-references** to related modules
- **Navigation links** to previous/next modules
- **Key features summary** at the end
- **Consistent formatting** and structure

## Benefits of Modular Structure

1. **Performance**: Each module is 300-800 lines, optimal for loading and editing
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to update individual sections
3. **Accessibility**: Users can load only relevant modules
4. **Searchability**: Better search results within focused content
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new modules or update existing ones

## Usage

1. **Start with the index**: `00_Healthcare_AI_Examples_Index.md`
2. **Navigate to specific modules** based on your healthcare AI application needs
3. **Follow cross-references** between related modules
4. **Use the navigation links** at the bottom of each module

## Integration with Original Documentation

This modular structure maintains all the content from the original comprehensive Healthcare AI Examples file while improving organization and accessibility. All code examples, implementation details, and architectural patterns are preserved across the modules.

## Dependencies

Each module is designed to be self-contained but includes references to related modules for comprehensive understanding. Some modules reference shared utilities and patterns documented in other modules.

## Future Enhancements

- **Interactive examples**: Add code execution capabilities
- **Visual diagrams**: Include more architecture diagrams and flowcharts
- **Case studies**: Add real-world implementation case studies
- **Performance metrics**: Include benchmarking and performance data
- **Video tutorials**: Add links to video demonstrations
