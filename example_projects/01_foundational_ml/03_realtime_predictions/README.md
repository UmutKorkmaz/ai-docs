# Real-time Prediction System

Production-ready real-time ML system with stream processing, low-latency predictions, and scalable microservices architecture.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project builds a high-performance real-time prediction system capable of handling thousands of predictions per second with sub-50ms latency, using Kafka for stream processing, Redis for caching, and FastAPI for serving.

### Key Features
- **Stream Processing**: Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion
- **Low-Latency API**: Sub-50ms prediction latency
- **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices with horizontal scaling
- **Real-time Feature Engineering**: On-the-fly feature calculation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Data Sources → Kafka Streams → Feature Engineering → Model Inference → Caching Layer → API Gateway → Monitoring
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
cd 03_realtime_predictions
docker-compose up -d
# System ready at http://localhost:8000
```

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

- **Throughput**: 10,000+ predictions/second
- **Latency**: < 50ms (p99)
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling with additional instances

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Stream Processing**: Apache Kafka, Kafka Streams
- **API Framework**: FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **Caching**: Redis Cluster
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes

## 📈 Use Cases

- **Real-time Fraud Detection**: Transaction monitoring and blocking
- **Live Recommendation Systems**: Personalized content delivery
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Real-time equipment monitoring
- **Financial Trading**: Algorithmic trading signals
