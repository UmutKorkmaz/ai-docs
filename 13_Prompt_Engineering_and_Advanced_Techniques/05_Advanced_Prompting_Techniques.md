        """

        response = self.model.generate(recovery_prompt)
        return self._parse_recovery_plan(response)
```

### ReAct Use Case Example

```
Prompt: You are an AI assistant that can reason and take actions. For each step, first think about what you need to do, then take the appropriate action.

Question: What's the weather like in Tokyo today, and should I bring an umbrella?

Thought: I need to get current weather information for Tokyo to answer this question accurately.

Action: search_weather("Tokyo, Japan", "today")

Observation: Current weather in Tokyo: 22°C, mostly cloudy with 70% chance of rain, humidity 85%

Thought: Based on the 70% chance of rain and high humidity, it would be wise to recommend bringing an umbrella.

Answer: The weather in Tokyo today is 22°C and mostly cloudy with a 70% chance of rain and high humidity (85%). Yes, you should definitely bring an umbrella as there's a high probability of rain.
```

### Enhanced ReAct Best Practices
- **Clear Tool Definitions**: Provide comprehensive tool documentation
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error recovery mechanisms
- **State Management**: Maintain clear state throughout the process
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor step progress and completion metrics
- **Confidence Assessment**: Evaluate confidence in each step and final answer

## 2. Self-Ask Prompting

### Introduction to Self-Ask

Self-Ask prompting enables models to break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions and answer them systematically. This approach is particularly effective for multi-hop reasoning and complex information retrieval tasks.

### Self-Ask Implementation

```
Question: How many people live in the capital of the country that won the most recent FIFA World Cup?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.

Follow up: Which country won the most recent FIFA World Cup?
Intermediate answer: Argentina won the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Follow up: What is the capital of Argentina?
Intermediate answer: The capital of Argentina is Buenos Aires.

Follow up: How many people live in Buenos Aires?
Intermediate answer: Buenos Aires has approximately 3.1 million people in the city proper and about 15.6 million in the metropolitan area.

So the final answer is: Approximately 3.1 million people live in Buenos Aires (city proper) or 15.6 million in the greater metropolitan area.
```

        3. Each question should provide information needed for the next
        4. Final question should directly lead to the answer

        Provide sub-questions in order:
        1. [First sub-question]

## 3. Generated Knowledge Prompting

### Introduction to Generated Knowledge

Generated Knowledge prompting involves first generating relevant knowledge about a topic, then using that knowledge to answer specific questions. This two-stage approach leverages the model's knowledge base more effectively.

### Generated Knowledge Implementation

```python
# Step 1: Generate relevant knowledge
knowledge_prompt = """
Generate relevant knowledge about renewable energy sources that would help answer questions about their environmental impact and efficiency.
"""

generated_knowledge = """
1. Solar panels convert sunlight to electricity with 15-22% efficiency
2. Wind turbines can achieve 35-45% efficiency
3. Hydroelectric power has 90%+ efficiency but requires suitable geography
4. Solar and wind have zero operational emissions
5. Manufacturing renewable systems has initial carbon footprint
"""

# Step 2: Use knowledge to answer specific question
answer_prompt = f"""
Knowledge: {generated_knowledge}

Question: Compare the environmental benefits of solar vs wind power.

Answer: Based on the knowledge provided...

        'structure': self._assess_structure(knowledge),
        'up_to_date': self._assess_currency(knowledge)
    }

    overall_score = sum(quality_metrics.values()) / len(quality_metrics)

    return {
        'quality_metrics': quality_metrics,
        'overall_score': overall_score,
        'improvement_suggestions': self._generate_improvement_suggestions(quality_metrics)
    }
```

## 5. Constitutional AI Prompting

### Introduction to Constitutional AI Prompting

Constitutional AI prompting incorporates explicit principles and constraints to ensure AI responses are helpful, harmless, and honest. This approach builds ethical considerations directly into the prompting process.

### Constitutional AI Implementation

```
Initial Response: [Model provides initial answer]

Constitutional Critique: "Review your response according to these principles:
1. Is it helpful and informative?
2. Is it harmless and avoids potential negative consequences?
3. Is it honest and acknowledges limitations?
4. Does it respect human autonomy and dignity?"

Revised Response: [Model provides improved response based on constitutional principles]
```

### Constitutional Framework

```python
class ConstitutionalPrompter:
    def __init__(self, model, constitution: list):
        self.model = model

        # Step 2: Constitutional review
        constitutional_review = self._constitutional_review(initial_response, prompt)

        # Step 3: Generate revised response if needed
        if constitutional_review['needs_revision']:
            revised_response = self._generate_revised_response(

## Advanced Prompting Strategy Integration

### Combining Multiple Techniques

The most effective approaches often combine multiple advanced techniques:

```python
class AdvancedPromptStrategy:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.react = EnhancedReAct(model, tools)
        self.self_ask = SelfAskPrompter(model)
        self.knowledge_generator = KnowledgeGenerator(model)
        self.constitutional = ConstitutionalPrompter(model, constitution)

    def solve_complex_multistep_problem(self, problem: str) -> dict:
        """Solve complex problems using integrated advanced techniques"""

        # Step 1: Generate relevant knowledge
        domain_knowledge = self.knowledge_generator.generate_domain_knowledge(
            self._extract_domain(problem),
            ['technical_details', 'practical_applications']
        )

        # Step 2: Constitutional framework setup
        constitutional_constraints = self.constitutional.setup_constraints(problem)

        # Step 3: ReAct with constitutional oversight
        result = self.react.solve_complex_problem_with_constraints(
            problem,
            constitutional_constraints,
            domain_knowledge
        )

        # Step 4: Self-Ask refinement if needed
        if result['confidence_score'] < 0.8:
            refined_result = self.self_ask.refine_low_confidence_result(
                result, domain_knowledge
            )
            result = refined_result

        return result
```

### Technique Selection Framework

```python
def select_optimal_technique(self, task_analysis: dict) -> list:
    """Select optimal techniques based on task characteristics"""

    technique_rules = {
        'multi_step_reasoning': ['react', 'self_ask'],
        'knowledge_intensive': ['generated_knowledge', 'self_ask'],
        'safety_critical': ['constitutional', 'directional_stimulus'],
        'creative_generation': ['directional_stimulus', 'generated_knowledge'],
        'decision_making': ['react', 'constitutional', 'self_ask']
    }

    selected_techniques = []
    for characteristic, techniques in technique_rules.items():
        if task_analysis.get(characteristic, False):
            selected_techniques.extend(techniques)

    return list(set(selected_techniques))  # Remove duplicates
```

## Performance Optimization

### Technique Effectiveness Metrics

```python
def evaluate_technique_effectiveness(self, technique_results: dict) -> dict:
    """Evaluate effectiveness of different prompting techniques"""

    effectiveness_metrics = {
        'accuracy': self._calculate_accuracy_metrics(technique_results),
        'efficiency': self._calculate_efficiency_metrics(technique_results),
        'consistency': self._calculate_consistency_metrics(technique_results),
        'user_satisfaction': self._calculate_satisfaction_metrics(technique_results),
        'adaptability': self._calculate_adaptability_metrics(technique_results)
    }

    # Calculate composite score
    composite_score = self._calculate_composite_score(effectiveness_metrics)

    return {
        'effectiveness_metrics': effectiveness_metrics,
        'composite_score': composite_score,
        'technique_ranking': self._rank_techniques(effectiveness_metrics),
        'optimization_suggestions': self._generate_optimization_suggestions(effectiveness_metrics)
    }
```

### Adaptive Technique Selection

```python
class AdaptiveTechniqueSelector:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.technique_performance = {}
        self.task_characteristics = {}

    def select_best_technique(self, task: str, context: dict) -> str:
        """Select best technique based on historical performance"""

        # Analyze task characteristics
        task_features = self._analyze_task_characteristics(task, context)

        # Retrieve historical performance
        similar_tasks = self._find_similar_tasks(task_features)

        # Predict best technique
        best_technique = self._predict_best_technique(similar_tasks, task_features)

        return best_technique

    def update_performance_data(self, technique: str, task: str,
                             performance: dict, context: dict):
        """Update performance data for technique selection improvement"""

        performance_entry = {
            'technique': technique,
            'task': task,
            'performance': performance,
            'context': context,
            'timestamp': datetime.now()
        }

        self.technique_performance.setdefault(technique, []).append(performance_entry)
```
