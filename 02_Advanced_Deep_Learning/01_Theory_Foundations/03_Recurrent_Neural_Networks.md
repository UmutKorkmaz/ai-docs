# 3. Recurrent Neural Networks and Sequential Processing

## Overview

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to process sequential data by maintaining an internal state that captures information from previous time steps. This chapter explores the theoretical foundations, architectural variations, and applications of RNNs in handling temporal dependencies and sequential patterns.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the mathematical foundations of recurrent connections
- Master RNN architectures including LSTMs and GRUs
- Analyze training challenges and optimization techniques
- Implement RNNs for various sequential processing tasks

## 3.1 Basic RNN Architecture

### 3.1.1 Mathematical Formulation

**Forward Pass:**
For input sequence $x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_T)$:

$h_t = \sigma(W_{hh} h_{t-1} + W_{xh} x_t + b_h)$
$y_t = W_{hy} h_t + b_y$

Where:
- $h_t$ is the hidden state at time step $t$
- $y_t$ is the output at time step $t$
- $W_{hh}$ is the hidden-to-hidden weight matrix
- $W_{xh}$ is the input-to-hidden weight matrix
- $W_{hy}$ is the hidden-to-output weight matrix
- $\sigma$ is the activation function (typically tanh)

**Parameter Sharing:**
Same parameters used across all time steps, enabling:
- Processing variable-length sequences
- Learning temporal patterns
- Parameter efficiency

### 3.1.2 Computational Graph

**Unrolled Representation:**
- Each time step becomes a layer in the computational graph
- Connections between layers represent temporal dependencies
- Backpropagation through time (BPTT) enables training

**Memory and Computation:**
- Memory: $O(T \cdot d_h)$ for storing hidden states
- Computation: $O(T \cdot (d_x \cdot d_h + d_h^2 + d_h \cdot d_y))$

## 3.2 Training RNNs

### 3.2.1 Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

**Gradient Calculation:**
For loss $\mathcal{L} = \sum_{t=1}^T \ell_t(y_t, \hat{y}_t)$:

$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_{hh}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{\partial \ell_t}{\partial W_{hh}} = \sum_{t=1}^T \sum_{k=1}^t \frac{\partial \ell_t}{\partial h_t} \frac{\partial h_t}{\partial h_k} \frac{\partial h_k}{\partial W_{hh}}$

**Temporal Gradient Flow:**
$\frac{\partial h_t}{\partial h_k} = \prod_{i=k}^{t-1} \frac{\partial h_{i+1}}{\partial h_i} = \prod_{i=k}^{t-1} W_{hh}^T \text{diag}(\sigma'(W_{hh}h_i + W_{xh}x_{i+1} + b_h))$

### 3.2.2 Vanishing and Exploding Gradients

**Vanishing Gradient Problem:**
- Gradients decay exponentially with sequence length
- Early time steps have negligible influence
- Difficulty learning long-range dependencies

**Exploding Gradient Problem:**
- Gradients grow exponentially with sequence length
- Training instability
- Numerical overflow

**Analysis:**
The Jacobian product determines gradient behavior:
$\|\frac{\partial h_t}{\partial h_k}\| \leq \|W_{hh}\|^{t-k} \cdot \gamma^{t-k}$

Where $\gamma$ is the maximum derivative of the activation function.

### 3.2.3 Gradient Clipping

**Clipping Strategies:**
- Norm clipping: $g = \min(1, \frac{threshold}{\|g\|}) \cdot g$
- Value clipping: $g = \text{clip}(g, -threshold, threshold)$

**Benefits:**
- Prevents exploding gradients
- Enables stable training
- Allows larger learning rates

## 3.3 Advanced RNN Architectures

### 3.3.1 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

**Gating Mechanisms:**
LSTM introduces three gates to control information flow:

**Forget Gate:**
$f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)$

**Input Gate:**
$i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)$

**Output Gate:**
$o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)$

**Cell State Update:**
$\tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)$
$C_t = f_t \odot C_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tilde{C}_t$

**Hidden State:**
$h_t = o_t \odot \tanh(C_t)$

**Key Features:**
- Explicit memory cell ($C_t$)
- Additive state updates
- Gated information flow
- Constant error carousel

### 3.3.2 Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

**Simplified Architecture:**
GRU combines forget and input gates:

**Update Gate:**
$z_t = \sigma(W_z \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_z)$

**Reset Gate:**
$r_t = \sigma(W_r \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_r)$

**Candidate State:**
$\tilde{h}_t = \tanh(W \cdot [r_t \odot h_{t-1}, x_t] + b)$

**Final State:**
$h_t = (1 - z_t) \odot h_{t-1} + z_t \odot \tilde{h}_t$

**Advantages:**
- Fewer parameters than LSTM
- Faster computation
- Similar performance on many tasks

### 3.3.3 Bidirectional RNNs

**Forward and Backward Processing:**
- Forward RNN: $\overrightarrow{h}_t = f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_t)$
- Backward RNN: $\overleftarrow{h}_t = f(x_T, x_{T-1}, ..., x_t)$

**Combined Representation:**
$h_t = [\overrightarrow{h}_t; \overleftarrow{h}_t]$

**Applications:**
- Machine translation
- Speech recognition
- Sequence labeling
- Sentiment analysis

### 3.3.4 Deep RNNs

**Stacked RNN Layers:**
$h_t^{(l)} = \sigma(W^{(l)} \cdot [h_{t-1}^{(l)}, h_t^{(l-1)}] + b^{(l)})$

**Skip Connections:**

**Benefits:**

**Context Vector:**
$c_t = \sum_{i=1}^T \alpha_{t,i} \bar{h}_i$

**Attention-based Output:**
$y_t = g(h_t, c_t)$

### 3.4.2 Self-Attention

**Query-Key-Value:**
$Q = W_q h$, $K = W_k h$, $V = W_v h$

**Attention Scores:**
$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V$
