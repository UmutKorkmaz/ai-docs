# 4. Transformers and Attention Mechanisms

## Overview

Transformers represent a paradigm shift in neural sequence modeling, replacing recurrent connections with self-attention mechanisms. This chapter provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation for understanding attention mechanisms, transformer architectures, and their variants.

## Learning Objectives

- Master the mathematical foundations of attention mechanisms
- Understand transformer architecture components and their interactions
- Analyze computational complexity and scaling properties
- Implement and optimize transformers for various applications

## 4.1 Attention Mechanisms

### 4.1.1 Basic Attention

**Query-Key-Value Framework:**
Attention computes a weighted sum of values based on query-key compatibility:

$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \sum_{i} \alpha_i v_i$

Where the attention weights $\alpha_i$ are computed as:

$\alpha_i = \frac{\exp(\text{score}(q, k_i))}{\sum_j \exp(\text{score}(q, k_j))}$

**Scoring Functions:**
- **Dot Product**: $\text{score}(q, k) = q^T k$
- **Scaled Dot Product**: $\text{score}(q, k) = \frac{q^T k}{\sqrt{d_k}}$
- **Additive/Concat**: $\text{score}(q, k) = v^T \tanh(W_q q + W_k k)$
- **Generalized Dot Product**: $\text{score}(q, k) = q^T W k$

### 4.1.2 Self-Attention

**Mathematical Formulation:**
For input sequence $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$:

$Q = X W_Q$, $K = X W_K$, $V = X W_V$

$\text{SelfAttention}(X) = \text{softmax}(\frac{X W_Q W_K^T X^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}) X W_V$

**Properties:**
- Captures relationships between all positions
- Permutation equivariant
- Global context integration
- Parallelizable computation

### 4.1.3 Multi-Head Attention

**Parallel Attention Heads:**
$\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h) W_O$

Where each head computes:

$\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(Q W_Q^i, K W_K^i, V W_V^i)$

**Benefits:**
- Captures different types of relationships
- Increases representation capacity
- Provides interpretability through different attention patterns
- Stabilizes training

**Parameter Count:**
$4 \times d_{model} \times d_{model} + h \times 4 \times d_{model} \times d_k$

## 4.2 Transformer Architecture

### 4.2.1 Encoder-Decoder Architecture

**Encoder Stack:**
Each encoder layer consists of:
1. Multi-head self-attention sublayer
2. Position-wise feed-forward network
3. Residual connections around each sublayer
4. Layer normalization after each sublayer

**Layer Normalization:**
$\text{LayerNorm}(x) = \gamma \cdot \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta$

**Residual Connections:**
$\text{SublayerOutput} = x + \text{Sublayer}(\text{LayerNorm}(x))$

### 4.2.2 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks

**Two-Layer MLP:**
$\text{FFN}(x) = \max(0, x W_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2$

**Typical Dimensions:**
- Input/output: $d_{model} = 512$
- Inner layer: $d_{ff} = 2048$ (4Ã— expansion)

**Computational Complexity:**
$O(n \cdot d_{model}^2 + n \cdot d_{model} \cdot d_{ff})$

### 4.2.3 Positional Encoding

**Sinusoidal Positional Encoding:**
$PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}})$
$PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}})$

**Learned Positional Embeddings:**
- Learned embeddings for each position
- More flexible but may not generalize to longer sequences
- Common in practice

**Relative Position Encoding:**
$PE_{(i,j)} = f(i-j)$ where $f$ is a learned function
Captures relative rather than absolute positions

### 4.2.4 Decoder Architecture

**Cross-Attention Layer:**
Attend to encoder outputs:

$\text{Attention}(Q, K_{encoder}, V_{encoder})$

**Masked Self-Attention:**
Prevent attending to future positions:

$\text{mask}_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } j > i \\
-\infty & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$

**Layer-by-Layer Processing:**
- Input embedding + positional encoding
- Multiple decoder layers
- Final linear layer and softmax

## 4.3 Computational Analysis

**Memory Requirements:**

- Parameter storage: $O(d^2)$
- Activations: $O(n \cdot d)$

### 4.3.2 Scaling Laws

**Parameter Scaling:**
Model performance scales predictably with parameter count:
$\mathcal{L}(N) \propto N^{-\alpha}$ where $N$ is parameter count

**Data Scaling:**
$\mathcal{L}(D) \propto D^{-\beta}$ where $D$ is dataset size

**Compute Scaling:**
$\mathcal{L}(C) \propto C^{-\gamma}$ where $C$ is compute budget

**Chinchilla Scaling Laws:**
Optimal parameter count: $N \propto D^{0.5}$
Optimal training tokens: $D \propto N^{2}$
